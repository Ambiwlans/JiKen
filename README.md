# JiKen

JiKen is a simple kanji quiz that uses statistics to accurately and quickly predict a user's knowledge level. I always found it tedious to need to get a good read of my current kanji level while studying using existing tests so I made this.

JiKen is a bit of a play on words/kanji. It could be read as 字検 (letter test, similar to 漢検 the government run kanji test) or 事件 (incident). I left it in romaji for the ambiguity. KTest was just a working title, and kind of lame.

I may rewrite this to use ML once I've collected enough data, but for now it is pretty simple statistics. It could also work well for vocab testing but that would be a .
