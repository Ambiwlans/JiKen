- show question # somewhere (chart mouseover?)
- show how many more before predictions
- resize chart as needed? 0~ (x,y=0)

- css tweaks for mobile
    - flipped card width/location
    - graph height (or length)
    
- less annoying logging
    - improve new question log (give full report incl testid)

- Reduce # of queries by ~90%

    - 2019-11-08T15:46:25.236992+00:00 app[web.1]: (Background on this error at: http://sqlalche.me/e/e3q8)
    - cached queries?
    - JawsDB cap is also 3600
    - both db's have tips sctns
    
- error screens

- online learning

- add kanji mouseovers for each dot

#TODO - GENERAL
    - new page for "end test" ...link to a testid value
    - error screens
    
#TODO - ALGORITHMIC
    - change bounds to use percentiles
        - make bounds shrink more with more data
    - add online learning adjustments to view (|%-.5|*2)^2 * ln(d)
        - keep moves small even at the high end to avoid abuse by individuals
        - only adjust when on round 10 or higher and t > 0.003 to avoid randoms
        
#TODO - BUGS
    - Still not great at 0~100
    - "non standard for", other blank kanji
            
#TODO - POLISH
    - commenting
    - data structuring
    - algorithms/code flow/refactoring
    - variable names, constants
    - move defaults/constants to DB / config.py
    - error catching of literally any sort ... (use default flask stuff i have in tab site, incl contact info)
    - looks good on mobile? (test sizes, touch controls, )
    - front page rewrite?
            
#TODO - STRUCTURAL
    - trim the req list significantly
    - clean out the init (cron and stuff should be own py)
    - handle DB size increases (5mb cap ... still far away)
    
#TODO - RELEASE!
    - alpha testing
    - going public
    - setup heroku notifications?
    
--------------------------

Expansion ideas:
- first test page overview showing shit
- use dotenv
- blog post about it ... or just stuff into the github.
- add 'share' buttons (esp for mobile) ... FB. (use a SS of test state?)
- add example words to stop ambiguity
- Historical rankings "You are #5/34830 tests!"
- ads
- patreon? probably not worth
- multiple language support! <-important. should work for at least japanese
- eventual switch to a slightly better ML algorithm
    - allow asymmetries
- support flashcards other than kanji (vocab?)
- other direction testing (definitions to kanji)
- snazzy animations for flips
- clientside the math
