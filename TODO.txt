- repeated answers shouldn't be allowed (f5 spam)
    - get rid of args (use ID for history)
        
- currently overwriting session when user does multiple tests instead of saving it and creating a new session
    - going to /test should just create a new session (right before creating the test df)

#TODO - HISTORY PAGE
    - 'end test' button? or just 'see advanced stats'?
    - 'back to test' button if there is an active test?
    - new page for "End/See Results" ...link to a testid value
    - add link to it on the test page
    - include links to other tests with same IP
    - show graph, score like during testing
    - show some metrics: #1 test!, Top 2%, Kanji missed from JLPT 5, Kanken 10
    - Test on: Yuki = 621, Seena = 441
    - Mention that it is a permalink that can be shared
    - include share buttons
    - add a 'try test' button that just goes to the home page
    - trigger sql dump from redis? needed to enable accurate ranking

- error screens (DB down, other)
    - contact info, apologies

#TODO - L2R
    - add online learning adjustments to view (|%-.5|*2)^2 * ln(d)
    - more whitepaper research on best methods
    - keep moves small even at the high end to avoid abuse by individuals
    - only adjust when on round 10 or higher and t > 0.003 to avoid randoms
    - learn to rank code done w/ online learning with the SQL dumps? or daily?
    
#TODO - UI
    - show question # somewhere (chart mouseover? above the kanji?)

#TODO - From BETA
    - what do numbers mean? (mobile)
        - mouseover alternatives?
        
#TODO - GENERAL
    - switch away from using params?
        - refreshing pg w/o clicking a link should just refresh the page and do nothing...
    - spacebar in main window should start test
    
#TODO - ALGORITHMIC
    - change bounds to use percentiles
        - make bounds shrink more with more data
    - add online learning adjustments to view (|%-.5|*2)^2 * ln(d)
        - keep moves small even at the high end to avoid abuse by individuals
        - only adjust when on round 10 or higher and t > 0.003 to avoid randoms
        
#TODO - BUGS
    - "non standard for", other blank kanji <-- just delete them from the DB
    - fix printout/log format kanji encoding (low prio)
    - Slow start up/wake up crashes many times before starting up
        - error msg 1: H12 "request timeout" 503 
        - CRITICAL WORKER TIMEOUT
        - SOLN: ... nothing run 'now' on startup.
    - SIGINT crash?
    - Occassional errors transferring to SQL?
    - sleep fucks over everything
        - SOLN: never sleep
            
#TODO - POLISH
    - commenting + ensure all unused code is actualy not running (jinja2)
    - data structuring
    - algorithms/code flow
    - shorten queries 'loads(current_app.config['SESSION_REDIS'].get('TestMaterial'),db.metadata,db.session)' -> lred('TestMaterial')?
    - error catching of literally any sort ... (use default flask stuff i have in tab site, incl contact info)
        - updater log should throw out more garbage tests and tests potentially broken data from redis ... verify we have fitting test/question data
    - front page rewrite?
    
--------------------------

Expansion ideas:
- send dono http://www.edrdg.org/edrdg/licence.html
- medium blog post about it ... or just stuff into the github.
- add 'share' buttons (esp for mobile) ... FB. (use a SS of test state?)
- add example words to stop ambiguity
- Historical rankings "You are #5/34830 tests!"
- ads
- patreon? probably not worth
- multiple language support! <-important. should work for at least japanese
- eventual switch to a slightly better ML algorithm
    - allow asymmetries
- support flashcards other than kanji (vocab?)
- other direction testing (definitions to kanji)
- clientside the math
- flask debugtoolbar
- lower # of calls to redis where viable (looks like redis stores it on the same box so little point)
- trim the req list further?
