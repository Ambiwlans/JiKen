#TODO - CLEANUP
    - commenting
    - data structuring
    - algorithms/code flow/refactoring
    - variable names, constants
    - move defaults/constants to DB / config.py
    - error catching
    - looks good on mobile? (test sizes, touch controls, )
        
#TODO4 - RANKS
    - add online learning adjustments to view (|%-.5|*2)^2 * ln(d)
        - keep moves small even at the high end to avoid abuse by individuals
        
#TODO4 - BUGS
    - Error catching to ensure the DB is ALWAYS flushed
        - sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) database is locked
        - may need to drop sqlite?
    - the algo is not very responsive to change ... stubborn?
        - got trapped in a flat estimation ... how? lol
        
#TODO5 - Deployment!
    - alpha testing
    - going public
    
--------------------------

Expansion ideas:
- resize chart as needed? 0~ (x,y=0)
- add 'share' buttons (esp for mobile) ... FB. (use a SS of test state?)
- add example words to stop ambiguity
- Historical rankings "You are #5/34830 tests!"
- ads
- patreon? probably not worth
- multiple language support! <-important. should work for at least japanese
- eventual switch to a slightly better ML algorithm
    - allow asymmetries
- support flashcards other than kanji (vocab?)
- other direction testing (definitions to kanji)
- snazzy animations for flips
- clientside the math
