- manually add vocab for 50 common kanji (1hr?)

Study list
    + make sort order better (handle the blanks and words corectly in levels)
        
- concat dataTables js

+ New reddit thread　(before doing this, do anki, and know how to avoid that double load issue?)
+ tweets, msg some teaching sites to see if they're interested, hit up dms
    
+++++++++++
MAIN
+++++++++++

- bold active tests in adminpage
- make a flush redis button in admin

Front end:
    ? more details on error page
    ? Language setting   
    Main graph
        - toggleable grade level vertbars for each grading type
        ? make lines visible only on history chart?
        
History:
    More Data
        ? time spent per question, total
        ? links to other tests with same IP. Use a cookie?
        - prettier breakdown by levels (JLPT,N3)
            - show estimated score per grade (loading bar? 92/120)
            ? circle graphs for levels? meh.

Study Mode:
    + setting for a max grade or jlpt level
    
Code Refactoring:
    - regularization / error bounds
    ? kanji->question meaning->answer etc.
    + get rid of magic numbers, switch to config variables, clean CSS, redo comments
    ? trim the req list further
    ? shorten queries 'loads(current_app.config['SESSION_REDIS'].get('TestMaterial'),db.metadata,db.session)' -> lred('TestMaterial')? (more readable)
    - rebuffer tests when opened in history to redis - save lots of sql calls (only bother if needed) - could also just up the linger time in redis - needs a new timestamp for 'old' tests (on creation?)
        
DB:
    ? track user devices in testlog (better return user guessing)
    - track study mode usage
    - save est result to testlog (mildly more accurate than saving a,t)
    
PR:
    - basic seo
    ? medium blog post about it ... or just stuff into the github. Or add an about section?
    - ask youglish about ad hosts?
    
BUGS:
    + Cookie “session” will be soon rejected because it has the “SameSite” attribute set to “None” or an invalid value, without the “secure” attribute. To know more about the “SameSite“ attribute, read https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite
    ? occassional timeouts since changing procfile to preload (only on jiken, not entest..?) (runs twice on opening?)
    ? updater not updating meta vals correctly? (check entest code)        
BOTH/CORE:
    * review git log to find changes to push across
    * update FP notices, tweak config, push through L2r changes if needed

From EN:
     ? the cur_pred stuff for now
     ? culm_pct ... don't need for kanji
     ? scaler (could add and set to 1 but meh.)
     
History:
    ? translate history page (not sure how it'd work for guests that don't speak jpns)
    ? hide graph on old history page (no points on graph), or say data deleted due to age, gen graph w/ no points?

Tweaks:
    ? get rid of question log ids
    ? clientside the math
    ? redo regularization
        ? change jump size penalty from regularization to just averaging
        ? make steepness penalties exponential not logarithmic (loss should explode)
        ? switch to a slightly better ML algorithm (model family) allowing assymetries (non-sigmoid?)
    Bad Predictions (start to Feb 2021)
        CLIFF (t>2- ie. 63005
        	- 7/4600
        	- typically over 50 questions
        TOO SHALLOW (0<t<.0002) - ie. 62627
        	- 19/4600
        	- avg questions ~30
        	- half are intentional/users fucking around?
        	- none recent
        FLAT (t=0) - ie. 63030
        	- 42/4600
        	- avg questions ~30
        	- possibly fixed
    	    - crazy prediction bug from minimize fn leading to /0 error ... re. images
            - probably needs a gradient when t <= 0 rather than a wall. Causes differentiability issues
            - https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/eq380w/made_an_app_that_tests_your_kanji_level_in_30/fes4muo/    
    ? switch away from using params in urls? ... would stop refresh bugs

BUGS:
    ? some tests vanish (why?)
    ? session mismatch (hasn't happened in ages)
        - related to resetting the server while tests are active gives the wrong number? (check where/when the 'current ID' number is pulled from)
        - on duplicate ID found, check contents if matched, or skip that number and attempt save again
    ? deleting a session manually doesn't seem to actually delete it... sessions may be persistent in multiple locations
