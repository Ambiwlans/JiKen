#TODO - CLEANUP
    - commenting
    - data structuring
    - algorithms/code flow/refactoring
    - variable names, constants
    - move defaults/constants to DB / config.py
    - error catching
    
#TODO - HTML/Layout/UI
    - show kanken and JLPT levels on mousover (based on lower bound estimate)
    - resize chart as needed? 0~ (x,y=0)
    - mouseovers for the extra data/numbers
    
#TODO - finish up stuff in view! models!        

#TODO4 - add 'share' buttons for sharing score on social media (FB) or a SS of the test state?
#TODO4 - full mobile support
    # looks good on verious devices/sizes
    # share buttons work
    # touch centric design

#TODO4 - CRON
    - recalc of: default a, t and my_ranks
    - use unbiased 1st questions ranks, frequency ranks, jlpt, kanken and lastly biased ranks. Randomly order anything left.
    - a, t can be simple averages?
    - remove /calc_ranks from view
    - add a #answered col to the testdata and metadata
    
#TODO4 - BUGS
    - Error catching to ensure the DB is ALWAYS flushed
        - sqlalchemy.exc.OperationalError: (sqlite3.OperationalError) database is locked
        - may need to drop sqlite?
    - the algo is not very responsive to change ... stubborn?
        - got trapped in a flat estimation ... how? lol
        
#TODO5 - Deployment!

--------------------------

Expanded ideas:
- add example words to stop ambiguity
- Historical rankings "You are #5/34830 tests!"
- ads
- patreon? probably not worth
- multiple language support! <-important. should work for at least japanese
- eventual switch to a slightly better ML algorithm
    - allow asymmetries
- support flashcards other than kanji (vocab?)
- other direction testing (definitions to kanji)
- snazzy animations for flips
- clientside the math
-
