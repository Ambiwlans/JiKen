- repeated answers shouldn't be allowed (f5 spam, double post)
    - switch away from using params? (use ID for history)
    - refreshing pg w/o clicking a link should just refresh the page and do nothing...
    - allow answered question overwrites for ppl that hit go back
        
- currently overwriting session when user does multiple tests instead of saving it and creating a new session
    - going to /test should just create a new session (right before creating the test df)

- show question # somewhere (chart mouseover? above the kanji?)

- error screens (DB down, other) (use default flask stuff i have in tab site, incl contact info)
    - contact info, apologies

- fade/grey the bounds font slightly

- incl some alpha stats on the readme, mention the phenomenon that allows us to use a sigmoid

- clear bounds from model/DB

#TODO - HISTORY PAGE
    - enable test page button for 'more stats/share/save' under the graph. Give it a mouseover.

    - links to other tests with same IP
    - Show testing/study suggestions: Easiest 10 Kanji missed from JLPT 5, Kanken 10, my_rank
        - continued testing for active tests within a grade/level?
        - button to make an anki deck with them?
    - include share buttons, mention permalink/bookmarks
    - add a 'new test' button that just goes to /test
    - more graphs?
    - make layout less shit
        
    - proper error page for test not found
    
    BUG - going to test without questions logged (cleared due to age) causes crash instead of showing graph with no nodes
        
#TODO - [?] button
    - opens lightbox with detailed instructions
    - Explain what "know it" means .... button mouseover? "Test yourself which kanji you know, however you want to define 'know'"
	- graph explanation :/ tricky...
	- click to flip!
	- get https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/eq380w/made_an_app_that_tests_your_kanji_level_in_30/feztk2c/ to test
	
#TODO - L2R
    - add online learning adjustments to view (|%-.5|*2)^2 * ln(d)
    - more whitepaper research on best methods
    - keep moves small even at the high end to avoid abuse by individuals
    - only adjust when on round 10 or higher and t > 0.003 to avoid randoms
    - learn to rank code done w/ online learning with the SQL dumps? or daily?
         
#TODO - ADS
    - side ads on pc, tiny bottom banner on phones
    - pick another ad service, adsense is ng for webapps.
        
#TODO - BUGS
    - "non standard for", other blank kanji <-- just delete them from the DB
    - updater log should throw out more garbage tests and tests potentially broken data from redis ... verify we have fitting test/question data
    

--------------------------
Low Prio:
- send dono http://www.edrdg.org/edrdg/licence.html
- track user devices in testlog
- shorten queries 'loads(current_app.config['SESSION_REDIS'].get('TestMaterial'),db.metadata,db.session)' -> lred('TestMaterial')?
- change bounds to use percentiles
    - make bounds shrink more with more data
- lower # of calls to redis where viable (looks like redis stores it on the same box so little point)
- trim the req list further?
- switch to a slightly better ML algorithm (model family) allowing assymetries (non-sigmoid?)
- clientside the math

Bugs:
    - fix printout/log format kanji encoding
    - Slow start up/wake up crashes many times before starting up
        - error msg 1: H12 "request timeout" 503 
        - CRITICAL WORKER TIMEOUT
        - SOLN: ... nothing run 'now' on startup.
    - SIGINT crash? Not sure if this still occurs
    - https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/eq380w/made_an_app_that_tests_your_kanji_level_in_30/fes4muo/
    	- add a gradient to negative t vals
    - skipping by 10 when logging to sql

PR
    - medium blog post about it ... or just stuff into the github.
    - patreon, buymeacoffee? probably not worth
    - reddit beta post (after adding history, [?])
--------------------------

Extensions:
- E->J
    - add example words to stop ambiguity
- Other cards sets (vocab for English, Jpns...)
