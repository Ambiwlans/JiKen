- make it results/share or add a permalink

- ð©¶— doesn't display - it is in CJK Extensions

- lower ad rate on pc, or change pc ad to a banner?

- more history pg stats
    - % of japanese you can read
    - switch to percentiles (need to add bins to metadata)
    	- could even make into graphs (you are here)         
    - time spent per question, total
    - max questions answered

#TODO - BUGS
    - crazy prediction bug from minimize fn leading to /0 error ... re. images
        - probably needs a gradient when t <= 0 rather than a wall. Causes differentiability issues
        - https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/eq380w/made_an_app_that_tests_your_kanji_level_in_30/fes4muo/
    
#TODO - PR
    - basic seo
    - open beta thread: new features - ads too annoying?, shareable/saveable tests, [?] button
    - tweets, msg some teaching sites to see if they're interested
    
--------------------------
Low Prio:
- rebuffer tests when opened in history to redis - save lots of sql calls (only bother if needed) - could also just up the linger time in redis - needs a new timestamp for 'old' tests (on creation?)
- ask whether to continue or to do a new test
? switch away from using params?
- incl some alpha stats on the readme, mention the phenomenon that allows us to use a sigmoid
? about section (other than the github)
- send dono http://www.edrdg.org/edrdg/licence.html
- track user devices in testlog
- shorten queries 'loads(current_app.config['SESSION_REDIS'].get('TestMaterial'),db.metadata,db.session)' -> lred('TestMaterial')? (more readable)
- change bounds to use percentiles
    - make bounds shrink more with more data
- lower # of calls to redis where viable (looks like redis stores it on the same box so little point)
- trim the req list further?
- switch to a slightly better ML algorithm (model family) allowing assymetries (non-sigmoid?)
- clientside the math
- extend hist pg kanji suggestions - tooltips, categories
? add a 'drills' feature for kanji missed on a test
? links to other tests with same IP. Use a cookie?
- error screen (DB down, other) - contact info, apologies, redirect
- reimplement L2R
    - add online learning adjustments to view (|%-.5|*2)^2 * ln(d)
    - more whitepaper research on best methods
    - keep moves small even at the high end to avoid abuse by individuals
    - only adjust when on round 10 or higher and t > 0.003 to avoid randoms
    - learn to rank code done w/ online learning with the SQL dumps? or daily?
        
Bugs:
    - Slow start up/wake up crashes many times before starting up
        - error msg 1: H12 "request timeout" 503 
        - CRITICAL WORKER TIMEOUT
        - SOLN: ... nothing run 'now' on startup.
    - SIGINT crash? Not sure if this still occurs

PR
    - medium blog post about it ... or just stuff into the github.
    - patreon, buymeacoffee? probably not worth

Extensions:
- E->J
    - needs example words to stop ambiguity
- Other cards sets (vocab for English, Jpns...)
- make an app
