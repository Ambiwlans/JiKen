#TODO - finish up stuff in view!

#TODO - section by section cleaning
    - commenting
    - data structuring
    - algorithms/code flow/refactoring
    - variable names, constants
    - move defaults/constants to DB / config.py

#TODO - tweak cost algorithm    
    - include a term that penalizes variance from avg_t
    
#TODO - show kanken and grade levels on front card
    - give them mouseovers?
    
#TODO2 - switch card flip to tap
    # add a hotkey to flip
    #? flip end over end?
    
#TODO3 - stop using BRs as padding

#TODO3 - occasional recalc of: default a,t and all my_ranks

#TODO3 - show graphs, score
    - can the already generated graph be used or just pass variables and graph in JS?

#TODO4 - add 'share' buttons for sharing score on social media (FB) or a SS of the test state?
#TODO4 - full mobile support
    # looks good on verious devices/sizes
    # share buttons work
    # touch centric design

#TODO4 - allow kanji reordering on the basis of first question (unbiased) responses
    # better my_rank selection, have it update weekly
    # use unbiased 1st questions ranks, frequency ranks, jlpt, kanken and lastly biased ranks. Randomly order anything left.
    
#TODO5 - Deployment!



Expanded ideas:
- Historical rankings "You are #5/34830 tests!"
- ads
- patreon? probably not worth
- multiple language support! <-important. should work for at least japanese
- eventual switch to a slightly better ML version
- support flashcards other than kanji (vocab?)
- other direction testing (definitions to kanji)
- snazzy animations for flips
