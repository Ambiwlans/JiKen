- ignore overly high missed words in study mode
- regularization / error bounds
+ add yomi to the history page review (same col)
     
+++++++++++
MAIN
+++++++++++

Front end:
    ? more details on error page
    ? Language setting   
    
History:
    + study list export to anki
    - breakdown by levels (JLPT,N3) ... show missed kanji, and estimated stats (loading bar? 92/120)
        - just add columns to the list?
        - Add lines on results graph for Grade levels and JLPT levels
        - circle graphs for levels? meh.
    ? time spent per question, total
    ? links to other tests with same IP. Use a cookie?

Study Mode:
    + setting for a max grade or jlpt level
    
Code Refactoring:
    ? kanji->question meaning->answer etc.
    + get rid of magic numbers, switch to config variables, clean CSS, redo comments
    ? trim the req list further
    ? shorten queries 'loads(current_app.config['SESSION_REDIS'].get('TestMaterial'),db.metadata,db.session)' -> lred('TestMaterial')? (more readable)
    - rebuffer tests when opened in history to redis - save lots of sql calls (only bother if needed) - could also just up the linger time in redis - needs a new timestamp for 'old' tests (on creation?)
        
DB:
    ? track user devices in testlog (better user guessing)
    - track study mode usage
    ? save est result to testlog (mildly more accurate than saving a,t)
    
PR:
    - basic seo
    - New reddit thread
    - tweets, msg some teaching sites to see if they're interested
    ? medium blog post about it ... or just stuff into the github. Or add an about section?
    
BUGS:

Misc:
            
BOTH/CORE:
    + review git log to find changes to push across

+++++++++++
LATER/Low Prio
+++++++++++

- convert to android app
? jp vocab vers
        
+++++++++++
MAYBE

From EN:
     ? the cur_pred stuff for now
     ? culm_pct ... don't need for kanji
     ? scaler (could add and set to 1 but meh.)
     
History:
    ? translate history page (not sure how it'd work for guests that don't speak jpns)
    ? hide graph on old history page (no points on graph), or say data deleted due to age, gen graph w/ no points?

Tweaks:
    ? get rid of question log ids
    ? clientside the math
    ? redo regularization
        ? change jump size penalty from regularization to just averaging
        ? make steepness penalties exponential not logarithmic (loss should explode)
        ? switch to a slightly better ML algorithm (model family) allowing assymetries (non-sigmoid?)
    Bad Predictions (start to Feb 2021)
        CLIFF (t>2- ie. 63005
        	- 7/4600
        	- typically over 50 questions
        TOO SHALLOW (0<t<.0002) - ie. 62627
        	- 19/4600
        	- avg questions ~30
        	- half are intentional/users fucking around?
        	- none recent
        FLAT (t=0) - ie. 63030
        	- 42/4600
        	- avg questions ~30
        	- possibly fixed
    	    - crazy prediction bug from minimize fn leading to /0 error ... re. images
            - probably needs a gradient when t <= 0 rather than a wall. Causes differentiability issues
            - https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/eq380w/made_an_app_that_tests_your_kanji_level_in_30/fes4muo/    
    ? switch away from using params in urls? ... would stop refresh bugs

BUGS:
    ? occassional timeouts since changing procfile to preload (only on jiken, not entest..?)
    ? some tests vanish (why?)
    ? session mismatch (hasn't happened in ages)
        - related to resetting the server while tests are active gives the wrong number? (check where/when the 'current ID' number is pulled from)
        - on duplicate ID found, check contents if matched, or skip that number and attempt save again
    ? deleting a session manually doesn't seem to actually delete it... sessions may be persistent in multiple locations
