+ find more users!
    + New reddit thread
    + msg some teaching sites/twitters to see if they're interested, hit up dms
        
- concat dataTables js gulp

Book Check:
    - put a link from /history, /home
    - out_a should be based on % chance to know each kanji (currently just counting about the a)
        - need to add sigmoid calc to js
    + generate a histogram for kanji distribution (if no test on file)
        + generate a combined user test + book graph to show dist of known and not-known words
        - need to make histo generic
    - Wordlist
        - use >30% know (currently using in_a straight)
        - limit to 50 kanji
        - switch to datatable
            ? use generic datatable and put in a js file?
    
+++++++++++
MAIN
+++++++++++

+ collect a bit more test data: studymode? End time? (and add to history page)

Book Check:

DRILL Mode:
	- start with a bunch of kanji, and drill ONLY those until complete
	- 'drill from test results' lets you create a new drill from a /t/
	- does not get saved
	- needs a more sensible end state.
    + how is the list data passed? list of ints should be pretty safe but need to check specs for url limit if i'm passing by param in url
    
Test Mode:
        
History:
    + book reccs
        - amazon w/ referal code?
        - have every book recc come with a histogram and user comparison
        - select a few books for the milestone lines
    - switch to same anki id, and add some data to allow a building collection
    ? links to other tests with same IP/device. Use a cookie?
    - rename vertlines milestone lines
    - make mwl sort order better (handle the blanks and words corectly in levels)
        
Study Mode:
    + setting for a max grade or jlpt level

Admin:
    - bold active tests in adminpage
    ? make a flush redis button in admin
    ? add a full reset fn to admin page (set config TEST_TIMEOUT to 0, force update)
    
Code Refactoring:
    - rebuffer tests when opened in history to redis - save lots of sql calls (only bother if needed) - could also just up the linger time in redis - needs a new timestamp for 'old' tests (on creation?)
    - switch from deprecated to_msgpack (use pyarrow?)
    ? kanji->question meaning->answer etc.
    ? trim the req list further
    ? shorten queries 'loads(current_app.config['SESSION_REDIS'].get('TestMaterial'),db.metadata,db.session)' -> lred('TestMaterial')? (more readable)

Logic:
    - revisit regularization again...
        
DB:
    ? track user devices in testlog (better return user guessing)
    ? save est result to testlog (mildly more accurate than saving a,t)
    ? a bit more kanji data? (strokes etc.)
	- scan a bunch of books, sites myself to make reccs in /history
    	- new table, saves the kanji distribution #s
        	- smallint * 7000 per book ... should be mostly 0s.    
PR:
    - basic seo
    ? medium blog post about it ... or just stuff into the github. Or add an about section?
    
BUGS:
    + vertbars vanish on mouseover
    + Cookie “session” will be soon rejected because it has the “SameSite” attribute set to “None” or an invalid value, without the “secure” attribute. To know more about the “SameSite“ attribute, read https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Set-Cookie/SameSite
    + occassional timeouts since changing procfile to preload (only on jiken, not entest..?) (runs twice on opening issue ... but may be better for high user load)
    ? updater not updating meta vals correctly? (check entest code)        
    ? words at extremes aren't reshuffling w/ l2r (like entest)
    
CONTINUOUS:
    * review git log to find changes to push across
    * update FP notices, tweak config, push through L2r changes if needed
    * get rid of magic numbers, switch to config variables, clean CSS, redo comments
    * tweets, msg some teaching sites to see if they're interested, hit up dms
    
+++++++++++
LATER/Low Prio
+++++++++++

- eventually set it to autopush l2r (after some big growth and nothing breaks)
- ask youglish about ad hosts? (after i have a userbase big enough)
+ convert to android app
? jp vocab vers
? Language settings
- offer book level check to bookstores? schools?

+++++++++++
MAYBE
+++++++++++

? more details on error page

From EN:
     ? the cur_pred stuff
     ? culm_pct ... don't rly need for kanji
     ? scaler (could add and set to 1 but meh.)
         
History:
    ? translate history page (not sure how it'd work for guests that don't speak jpns)
    ? hide graph on old history page (no points on graph), or say data deleted due to age, gen graph w/ no points?

Tweaks:
    ? get rid of question log ids
    ? clientside the math
    ? redo regularization
        ? change jump size penalty from regularization to just averaging
        ? make steepness penalties exponential not logarithmic (loss should explode)
        ? switch to a slightly better ML algorithm (model family) allowing assymetries (non-sigmoid?)
    Bad Predictions (start to Feb 2021)
        CLIFF (t>2- ie. 63005
        	- 7/4600
        	- typically over 50 questions
        TOO SHALLOW (0<t<.0002) - ie. 62627
        	- 19/4600
        	- avg questions ~30
        	- half are intentional/users fucking around?
        	- none recent
        FLAT (t=0) - ie. 63030
        	- 42/4600
        	- avg questions ~30
        	- possibly fixed
    	    - crazy prediction bug from minimize fn leading to /0 error ... re. images
            - probably needs a gradient when t <= 0 rather than a wall. Causes differentiability issues
            - https://www.reddit.com/r/LearnJapanese/comments/eq380w/made_an_app_that_tests_your_kanji_level_in_30/fes4muo/    
    ? switch away from using params in urls? ... would stop refresh bugs

BUGS:
    ? some tests vanish (why?)
    ? session mismatch (hasn't happened in ages)
        - related to resetting the server while tests are active gives the wrong number? (check where/when the 'current ID' number is pulled from)
        - on duplicate ID found, check contents if matched, or skip that number and attempt save again
    ? deleting a session manually doesn't seem to actually delete it... sessions may be persistent in multiple locations
