		<p>JiKen uses machine learning to estimate your Kanji skills in as few questions as possible. 
    		Each test reacts to your answers. 
    		Answer more questions to train the program and fine tune the estimate.</p>
		<p>Keep in mind that this is still in a very alpha state. Report any bugs you find!</p>
