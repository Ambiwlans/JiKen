		<p>JiKen uses statistics from users like you to estimate your Kanji knowledge in as few questions as possible (as few as 10 questions gives a reasonable estimate!). 
    		Each test reacts to your answers. 
    		Answer more questions to train the program and fine tune your estimate.</p>
		<p>Keep in mind that this is still in a <i>very</i> alpha state. <a href="https://github.com/Ambiwlans/KTest">Report any bugs</a> you find!</p>
